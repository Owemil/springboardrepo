He was adopted and returned back to us when his family could no longer care for him.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Foster Update:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<font color=\"#222222\" face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=\"2\"> \n<span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Meet Walter! He is a special boy looking for his forever family. In his foster home, Walter is driven by toys and especially loves playing fetch. He has good energy, and really enjoys taking walks outside. He has displayed good leash manners a majority of the time, but has pulled when he is excited. Ongoing leash training will be a benefit to Walter, so that he can continue with positive leash manners. He is very smart and motivated, and has learned a variety of tricks, from &quot;roll over&quot; to &quot;paw&quot; or &quot;bang&quot; from his foster. Walter&#39;s largest hurdles have been his wariness around strangers, and necessity for clear boundaries from his humans. While Walter is very affectionate with his foster family, he can take a little time to warm up to someone new, and does not appreciate strangers trying to pet him. It is important that his forever family can advocate for him when out in public or around new people, as it can be stressful for Walter if he feels like he always has to stand up for his needs. There are times where Walter may test boundaries within the home or be a bit more mouthy to communicate, so it is important that his family is comfortable setting clear boundaries for Walter so he knows what behaviors are and aren&#39;t allowed. The more Walter has clear expectations to follow and is advocated for, the more he can thrive. Due to his ability to be more mouthy, we are looking for an adult-only home for him.</span>\n</font></p>\n\n<p><strong>Adoption Info:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Adoption fee is $550 which includes spay/neuter, core vaccinations per AVMA standards, heartworm test if applicable, and microchip with lifetime registration.
